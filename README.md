# Phonebook
Designed in C++

The User can search for a phone number from the directory, can add/delete a legit 10 digit number, get count of record and delete the phonebook if they wish to do so.

If the user doesn't want to fill the phonebook by themselves, they can also automate the process and the entries will be randomly generated numbers.
